# Status and tracking

## Current global status

Current phase: Controlled implementation — first vertical slice started

## Completed recently

- ADR 0010 added for health-exclusive ontology and architecturalized compliance
- strategic regulatory backlog added (break-glass, legal retention vs visibility, regulatory audit pathways, assinatura digital qualificada, interoperability roadmap)
- first slice now derives typed referral and prescription drafts from the same session/SOAP/context spine, with persisted artifacts, events, and provenance while keeping both explicitly draft-only

- FirstSliceRunner now uses deterministic bounded retrieval + provenance/event wiring instead of hardcoded synthetic context list
- Scribe bridge state now exposes retrieval source/status/match preview for future UI wiring
- shared HealthOS envelope vocabulary added for first-slice command/result semantics (`HealthOSCommandDisposition`, `HealthOSIssueCode`, `HealthOSFailureKind`, `HealthOSIssue`)
- Scribe bridge + CLI adapter migrated from ad hoc issue strings to shared typed issue/disposition semantics
- first-slice runner/adapter wiring extracted into shared Swift support target so CLI and app surfaces consume the same executable slice path
- minimal macOS SwiftUI Scribe surface added as `HealthOSScribeApp` with a small observable view model over `ScribeFirstSliceFacade`
- local validation now covers both `swift run HealthOSCLI` and `swift run HealthOSScribeApp --smoke-test`
- first slice now accepts seeded text or local audio file capture, persists local audio artifacts, and surfaces explicit transcription state (`ready` / `degraded` / `unavailable`)
- local validation now also covers `swift run HealthOSCLI --audio-file /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff` and `swift run HealthOSScribeApp --smoke-test-audio`
- bounded retrieval now carries richer snippet/index/match metadata, deterministic score breakdown, and a structured `RetrievalContextPackage` between raw matches and AACI draft composition
- first-slice local context assembly now produces explicit `ready` / `partial` / `empty` / `degraded` states with summary/highlights/source hints for both CLI and Scribe
- local validation now confirms the strengthened retrieval/context path across CLI and Scribe seeded-text and local-audio smoke flows
- first-slice gate workflow now carries richer review semantics (review type, target, rationale, reviewer role/timestamp) and keeps gate rejection explicit without treating it as a technical crash
- SOAP draft and finalized SOAP document are now separate typed contracts with explicit lineage between source draft, gate request/resolution, and persisted final document
- minimal Scribe surface now shows draft preview, gate review summary, and finalized-document state/path as distinct truths
- local validation now also confirms explicit approve/reject semantics, including withheld final-document state on CLI rejection runs

## In progress

- first vertical slice implementation continues with seeded-text compatibility, a structured local retrieval/context package, richer gate/document semantics, draft-only referral/prescription derivatives, and a now-wired local-audio path, while real local transcription and earlier draft-refresh finalization remain deferred
- doctrinal language hardening completed for sovereignty/privacy/compliance/topology without introducing infrastructure expansion
- GOS now exists as doctrine + schema + authoring workspace + schema-aware compiler/validator/CLI + lifecycle/bundle posture + Swift runtime contracts + minimal AACI activation/load seams + first-slice mediated draft usage, while deeper runtime adoption and hardening still remain open

## Known gaps

- microphone capture is not implemented yet; the current local-first audio path uses file selection/import
- local transcription remains stubbed, so audio capture degrades honestly instead of yielding fabricated transcript text
- bounded retrieval now uses a stronger local score (lexical/tag/recency/category/intent), but still stops well short of semantic retrieval or embeddings
- Scribe now has a minimal validation UI surface, but it is not yet a full/final app shell
- draft refresh remains preview/degraded until gate resolution runs the full executable spine
- referral/prescription drafts now exist, but their regulatory effectuation/issuance remains intentionally deferred
- GOS still needs stronger human review/activation mechanics, stronger registry hardening, and deeper execution-time adoption inside AACI subagent paths

## Open blockers / decisions

- decide when to replace the current stubbed local transcription path with a real local Apple-first transcription provider
- decide whether the next first-slice step after this wave is microphone capture, moving draft/retrieval finalization earlier than gate resolution, or introducing lawful effectuation paths for referral/prescription
- decide when to convert the AI skills into enforced reusable workflows/templates
- decide when to replace the current deterministic local retrieval/context package with semantic/clinical retrieval while preserving lawful scope and topology-invariant governance constraints
- decide the final human-facing review/activation policy for compiled GOS bundles and when to harden GOS activation beyond the current minimal runtime seams

## Tracking rules
